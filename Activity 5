1. Why do we need to perform memory testing?
  - It is important to test your memory and catch these faults, both in the testing process and during operation.
    Memory leaks, fragmentation, and even crosstalk can affect your memory units. 
    If you're not prepared this could lead to individual system failures or even cascading failures.
